            <p>Takeaway should be the ultimate mini fist pump, so if something’s not quite right, that’s no good. If your order has just arrived and you’re not happy, it’s always best to contact the restaurant directly. Here’s how:</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Find your order confirmation email.</p>
            <p>You’ll then find the restaurant’s contact number below your order summary.</p>
            <p>Give the restaurant a call, explain why you’re unhappy with your food, and see what they’re able to do to put things right.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>We can’t guarantee that this call will result in things being put right immediately, but unsatisfactory food is often the result of mishap. So it’s totally worth calling them. Here’s where we come in.</p>
            <p>If you’re still not happy with the restaurant, you should get in touch with us (with your order number handy) and we’ll pick up the case for you.</p>
